# kafka-tutorial
Playground for basic local setup of a kafka broker, publisher &amp; consumer ecosystem, with producers and consumers 
written in python.

**TODO:**
* Pick python library for kafka client
  * E.g. best maintained etc
* Docker build job with entry point for both consumer and publisher
* docker-compose 
* Images / diagrams for repo
* Docs / tutorials

**Longer term todo:**
* Anything else from kafka ecosystem e.g. kafka connect
*
